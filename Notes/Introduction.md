- Open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.
- A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
-  Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
- Both the browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming language.

### Event-Driven architecture:
- applications respond to events changes in state, user input, or messages from other programs.
